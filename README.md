# Air-Quality-Index-prediction
The Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Dashboard is a machine learning–powered web application built using Streamlit. It predicts the overall AQI (Air Quality Index) based on key air pollutant parameters such as CO, NO₂, O₃, and PM2.5. The system uses multiple regression-based models — including XGBoost, Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge.
